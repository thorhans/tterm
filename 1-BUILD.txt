
TTerm
************************************************************

(1) Building TTerm
============================================================

- Install the tools described in section (2) below.


- To install the build type `debug´ with the flavor `dev´ on the
  connected Android device:

    gradle installDevDebug


- To assemble and sign the build type `release´ with the flavor
  `prod´:

    gradle assembleProdRelease

  It places the APK in
  
    term/prod/release/term-prod-release.apk

  - TODO That only works from Android Studio, not from a shell. What's
    wrong?

  Then install the APK with:
  
    cd $and/tterm
    adb install term/prod/release/term-prod-release.apk

  - TODO On my device it complains about uninstalling, then I have to
    uninstall the app for all Android users on the device, which means
    that I loose the configuration. Research that further: There is a
    switch for `adb uninstall´ to keep the config.
