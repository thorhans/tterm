<h1>Support for different keyboards</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>I test TTerm regularly with the on-screen keyboards:</p>

<ul class="narrow">
  <li>Swype, my current favorite</li>
  
  <li>Google's GBoard</li>
</ul>

<p>I occasionally test it with the on-screen keyboards:</p>

<ul class="narrow">
  <li>Hacker's Keyboard</li>

  <li>Samsung's keyboard on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 WiFi (2016),
  SM-T713, with Android 7</li>
</ul>

<p>And I occasionally test it with Bluetooth keyboards.</p>

<p>There are a surprising amount of differences between on-screen
keyboards. If you find bugs on your favorite on-screen keyboard, send
a bug report to
  <a href="mailto:thorbj.hansen@gmail.com?subject=TTerm"
     >thorbj.hansen@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>You currently must set the setting <setting>input mode</setting> to
<i>character based</i>, then <em>typing</em> works in all keyboards
I've tested (where <em>typing</em> means that you press a key, release
it, then press the next key).</p>

<p><em>Swiping</em> (also called <em>gesture typing</em>) is a
different matter. Every swipe keyboard seems to behave differently, so
I'll return to that later.</p>

<h1>Devices</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>I test TTerm regularly on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a rooted Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5 WiFi (SM-T800, chagallwifi)
  with a 10" screen and LineageOS 14.1 (equivalent to Android 7.1
  Nougat)</li>

  <li>a rooted Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0 WiFi (2016), SM-T713 with an
  8" screen and Android 7</li>
</ul>

<p>I occasionally test on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an unrooted Galaxy S3 Neo (GT-I9301I) with a 4.8" screen and
  Android 4.4</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find bugs on a different device, send a bug report to
  <a href="mailto:thorbj.hansen@gmail.com?subject=TTerm"
     >thorbj.hansen@gmail.com</a>.</p>


<h1>Changes to TEA</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>TTerm has the same features as <a href="tea.xhtml">TEA</a>, with
the changes listed below.</p>

<p>For detailed changes, see the 
  <a href="changelog.xhtml">changelog</a>.</p>


<h2>Added features</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Extra keys for <k>Ctrl</k>, <k>Tab</k>, <k>Esc</k>, <k>/</k>,
    <k>-</k>, the cursor keys and <k>Fn</k>, so that you can continue
    using your favorite on-screen keyboard. The cursor keys have
    auto-repeat. For details, see
      <a href="usage.xhtml#keyboard"
         >Usage: Keyboard</a>.</p>

    <p>Key combinations with <k>Ctrl</k>, <k>Esc</k> and <k>Fn</k>
    currently only work when the setting <setting>input mode</setting>
    is set to <i>character-based</i>.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>Suggestions for swiped words do not overwrite consecutive
    text.</p>
    
    <p class="TODO">LATER As of 2018-01, this no longer works,
    I'll investigate it later.</p>
    
    <p>Some swipe keyboards display a <em>suggestion</em> which you
    have to <em>commit</em>, e.g. by pressing space or a punctuation
    key, or <em>discard</em>, e.g. by pressing backspace. For an
    example, try out the Google keyboard.</p>
    
    <p>When typing in the middle of a line, TEA's suggestion
    <em>overwrites</em> the following text until you commit. TTerm
    tries to move the following text to the right. (That's not always
    the right thing to do, but in most cases it is more intuitive than
    TEA's approach.)</p>
    
    <p>Example: Select the Google keyboard. Enter <c>one
    two</c>. Put the cursor on <c>t</c>. Enter
    <c>hello</c> without pressing space. Now TEA shows
      <c>one <selected>hello</selected></c>,
    and TTerm shows 
      <c>one <selected>hello</selected>two</c>.
    When you press space, TEA inserts <c>hello</c> and shows
    <c>two</c> again. So no text is lost, but I find TEA's
    behavior very confusing.</p>
  </li>

  <li>Local help files that you can read when you are offline.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Removed features</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<ul>
  <li>TTerm requires Android 4.4 or newer to run.</li>

  <li>
    <p>At the moment, TTerm's GUI is in English, and I have no plans
    to translate the GUI to other languages.</p>
    
    <p>To clarify: Programs running inside TTerm can run in any
    language, but TTerm's menu and settings are in English.</p>
    
    <p>If you want your GUI in another language, use TEA.</p>
  </li>
</ul>



<h2>Changed features</h2>
<!-- ============================================================ -->

<ul>
  <li>I've changed some of the mappings for <k>Ctrl</k> and <k>Fn</k>,
  see
      <a href="usage.xhtml#keyboard"
         >Usage: Keyboard</a>.</li>
</ul>
