<h1>What do you need TTerm for?</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>Android runs on top of a (small) Linux layer. To call Linux
commands interactively, you need a "shell" and a "terminal emulator".
The terminal emulator displays your input and the commands' output,
but the shell actually calls the Linux commands.</p>

<p>Android comes with a shell, but not with a terminal emulator,
that's what you need TTerm for.</p>

<p>I'll try to explain everything that I found difficult when I
started using Linux on Android. But you need familiarity with Linux or
Unix to understand this. If you don't understand anything that's
written here, have a look at a book about Linux for beginners before
you continue. Yes, a book about Linux, not a book about Android.</p>


<h1>Android's shell</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>Android's shell is in <code>/system/bin/sh</code>. Since Android
4.0 it is the MirBSD Korn shell, also called Mksh, see
  <a href="mksh.xhtml" >Android's shell</a>.</p>

<p>If you are used to a different shell or distribuition, you can
install it and have TTerm start it, see
  <a href="shells.xhtml" >Shells and distributions</a>.</p>


<h1>For the impatient</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>For the impatient that start using TTerm right away: If TTerm does
not behave as you expect, look at the following settings:</p>

<ul>
  <li><setting>UTF-8</setting></li>
  
  <li><setting>Input method</setting>: character based or
  word-based</li>

  <li><setting>Alt key sends ESC</setting></li>

  <li><setting>Terminal type</setting></li>

  <li><setting>Send mouse events</setting></li>
</ul>

<p>I'll add more details in the future.</p>


<h1>Starting a different shell</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>You can change the shell that is started with the setting
<setting>Command line</setting>. See
  <a href="shells.xhtml" >Shells and distributions</a> 
for examples.</p>

<p>You can specify an 
  <a href="config.xhtml#setting/initial_command"
     ><setting>Initial command</setting></a>
that is sent to the shell as user input, i.e. as if you had typed
it.</p>


<h1>Running a command from the home screen</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>You can use the <dfn>TTerm widget</dfn> to run a command from an
icon on the home screen.</p>
