<h1>About shells and distribuitions</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>Android runs on top of a (small) Linux layer. To call Linux
commands interactively, you need a "shell" and a "terminal
emulator".</p>

<p>TTerm is the <dfn>terminal emulator</dfn>. It displays your
input (what you type) and the commands' output, but it doesn't
actually execute any Linux commands. That's the job of the
<dfn>shell</dfn>. The shell actually understands your input and calls
the Linux commands that you specify. The corresponding thing in
Windows are the two "command shells" <c>cmd</c> and
<c>powershell</c>.</p>

<p>Linux offers many different shells. This chapter lists some
alternatives that I've tested in TTerm.</p>

<p>The shell contains some <dfn>built-in command</dfn>s, also called
<dfn>built-in</dfn>s, like <c>cd</c> to change the shell's
current directory. But most commands are not part of the shell, even
basic commands like <c>ls</c> to list the contents of a
directory, or <c>cp</c> to copy a file  A Linux
<dfn>distribution</dfn> is a prepackaged sets of Linux commands that
you can install.</p>

<p>Linux also offers many different distribuitions. This chapter lists
some alternatives that I've tested in TTerm.</p>


<h1>Further reading</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>I'll try to explain everything that I found difficult when I
started using Linux on Android. But you need familiarity with Linux or
Unix to understand this. If you don't understand anything that's
written here, have a look at a book about Linux for beginners before
you continue. Yes, a book about Linux, not a book about Android.</p>
