<h1>About Debian</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>Android's Linux layer is very small, but there are several full
Debian GNU/Linux distributions that run with <code>proot</code> or
<code>chroot</code>.</p>


<h1>Running GNURoot Debian in TTerm</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>The excellent app
  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details/apps/details?id=com.gnuroot.debian"
     >GNURoot Debian</a>
is a <b>full Debian Linux distribution</b> that runs as an app using 
  <a href="https://proot-me.github.io" 
    ><code>proot</code></a>.
That means that it doesn't run on Android's Linux and file system like
  <a href="termux.xhtml" >Termux</a>
does, it has its own file system and starts Debian in it. It doesn't
require <a href="rooting">rooting</a>. And it has 
  <a href="emacs.xhtml" > Emacs</a>, 
hooray!</p>

<p>GNURoot Debian has its own terminal emulator, but on a rooted
device you can use TTerm instead. (Currently the terminal emulator of
GNURoot Debian handles resizing better than TTerm, you might want to
wait until TTerm improves.)</p>

<p>This seems to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start TTerm and change to root with <code>su</code>, or to the GNURoot Debian user.
  To find out the GNURoot Debian user, start it and enter <code>whoami</code>, then
  return to TTerm. On my device it runs as user <code>u0_a81</code>, so I
  change to it with <code>su u0_a81</code>.</li>

  <li>
    <p>Start Debian:</p>

    <p class="indent code">
    cd /data/data/com.gnuroot.debian/support<br/>
    LD_PRELOAD=" " ./busybox sh execInPRoot</p>

    <p>It shows two errors, but seems to work anyway.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That's it, now you can start a Debian command, e.g.
<code>bash</code> or <code>emacs</code> (after installing it with
<code>apt install emacs</code>).</p>

<p>If you don't want to root your device, you could try to find a SSH
client that runs in TTerm and start a SSH server in Debian. I have not
tried that yet.</p>
