<h1>About BusyBox</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>Android's Linux layer is very small. BusyBox contains most missing
Unix commands. It is an open-source collection of many stripped-down
Unix commands. They are bundled in a single executable binary, which
makes it easy to install.</p>

<p>For details, consult the 
  <a href="https://busybox.net/about.html"
     >home page</a>
and the 
  <a href="https://busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html"
     >documentation.</a>.</p>

<p>If the BusyBox commands lack features that you need, take a look at
  <a href="termux.xhtml">Termux</a>
or 
  <a href="debian.xhtml">Debian</a>.</p>


<h1>Running BusyBox's shell in TTerm</h1>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>BusyBox does not contain a terminal emulator like TTerm. There are
several approaches to run BusyBox in TTerm:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#run/rooted">Install BusyBox on a rooted
  device</a></li>

  <li><a href="#run/unrooted">Install BusyBox on an unrooted
  device</a></li>
  
  <li><a href="#run/copy">Copy a BusyBox binary into TTerm's internal
  storage</a></li>

  <li><a href="#run/connect">Connect to an app that contains BusyBox,
  e.g. Termux</a></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="run/rooted">Install BusyBox on a rooted device</h2>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>If you have a 
  <a href="../rooting.xhtml">rooted device</a>,
you can install BusyBox to <code>/system/xbin</code>, where it's
accessible for all apps.</p>

<p>In fact, you might already have installed BusyBox during rooting.
If you have a custom ROM like LineageOS or a recovery image like TWRP,
BusyBox might also already be installed. Look in
<code>/system/xbin</code> or <code>/su/xbin</code>.</p>

<p>There are several BusyBox apps. In January 2018, the following two
were popular.</p>

<p class="disclaimer">Disclaimer: I've come across obviously suspicios
and not so obviously suspicious software while researching for TTerm.
I've researched all tools I mention to my best ability, but be aware
that you must use your own judgement and only install programs from
sources that <b>you</b> trust.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stericson.busybox"
         >BusyBox by Stephen (Stericson)</a>, 
  with the current version 1.27.2 (as of 2018-01-08)</li>

  <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrummy.busybox.installer"
         >BusyBox for Android by JRummy Apps</a>
  with the older version 1.26.2 (as of 2018-01-08)</li>

  <li><a href="termux.xhtml"
         >Termux</a> 
  includes BusyBox, and a lot more, and does not require rooting.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you install BusyBox to <code>/system/bin/xbin</code>, then the
default value of
  <a href="../config.xhtml#env/PATH"
     ><code>$PATH</code></a>
will first look for the preinstalled Android commands in
<code>/system/bin/</code>, then for additional BusyBox commands in
<code>/system/bin/xbin</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to call a BusyBox command <code>cmd</code> with the
same name as a preinstalled Android command, you can call it with
<code>busybox cmd</code>.</p>

<p>If you always prefer the BusyBox commands, change
  <a href="config.xthml#env/PATH"
    ><code>$PATH</code></a>
so that <code>/system/bin/xbin</code> comes before
<code>/system/bin/bin</code>.</p>


<h2 id="run/unrooted">Install BusyBox on an unrooted device</h2> 
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>In January 2018 it appears that only apps containing their own
terminal emulator can run BusyBox, for example
  <a href="termux.xhtml">Termux</a>,
which includes BusyBox, and a lot more, and does not require
rooting.</p>


<p>In the past, there was at least one app that allowed Busybox to run
on an unrooted device with Android 4.4 to 6 (not Android 7 or later)
and call it from TTerm. It was the app
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrummy.busybox.installer"
     >BusyBox for Android by JRummy Apps</a>.
In it, you could start TTerm via the menu icon (the icon with the
three dots at the top right), then select "Terminal". That set
<code>$PATH</code> to:</p>

<p class="indent code">
  PATH=/data/user/0/com.jrummy.busybox.installer/files/bin:$PATH
</p>

<p>and started TTerm. But on 2018-01-10 that location is no longer
readable on my Android 4.4 device where it used to work.</p>

<p>You can still use the app to run scripts that use BusyBox on an
unrooted device, but they don't accept input from a terminal.</p>


<h2 id="run/copy">Copy a BusyBox binary into TTerm's internal storage</h2>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>What still works is to copy a BusyBox binary into TTerms internal
storage. You'll need a binary for your 
  <a href="../concepts.xhtml#cpu_architecture">CPU architecture</a>, e.g.
ARM or x86.</p>

<p>There are several BusyBox binaries. In January 2018, I found
these:</p>

and not so obviously suspicious software while researching for TTerm.
I've researched all tools I mention to my best ability, but be aware

         >The repository for BusyBox for Android by JRummy Apps</a>
  with the older version 1.26.2 (as of 2018-01-08)</li>

  <li><a href="http://termux.net/dists/stable/main"
         >The repository for Termux</a> 
  works, but has less included commands (as of 2018-01-08)</li>

</ul>

<p>The binary of BusyBox is a single file. Copy it to a directory in
TTerm's internal storage, create the soft links and add the directory
to your <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
                 
<p class="TODO">TODO I'll add a detailed description in a future
release.</p>


<h2 id="run/connect">Connect to an app that contains BusyBox, e.g. Termux</h2>
<!-- ************************************************************ -->

<p>In this approach, you start an app that contains BusyBox, and start
a program that you connect to from TTerm. Alternatives are Netcat
(<code>nc</code> or <code>netcat</code>) and the Telnet daemon
(<code>telnetd</code>).</p>
