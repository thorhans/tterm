
From TEA 1.0.70 to TTerm 0.1.8
************************************************************

- I started with TEA 1.0.70.

  Since the first TTerm version that I published on GitHub was TTerm
  0.1.8, the changes from TEA 1.0.70 to TTerm 0.1.8 are not documented
  on GitHub.

  If you want to understand what I changed up to version 0.1.8, this
  section outlines what I did.


- On 2017-03-14, I downloaded the source of TEA 1.0.70 from:

    https://github.com/jackpal/Android-Terminal-Emulator

  The changes that I needed to do to get it to compile with Android
  Studio 2.3 and Android SDK 22 (Android 5.1) are documented in

    ./docs/tea/build-tea.txt


- Major changes before I published TTerm 0.1.8 on GitHub

  - The changes described in
  
      ./docs/tea/build-tea.txt

  - The changes described in the change log in the section "Code
    changes":
  
      ./term/src/main/assets/changelog.xhtml

    Look at it in a browser with:

      file://.../term/src/main/assets/changelog.xhtml#code-changes


- For all other changes, consult GitHub, which has the changes since
  TTerm 0.1.8.
